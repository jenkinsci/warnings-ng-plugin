The Jenkins Next Generation Warnings plugin collects compiler warnings or issues reported by static analysis tools and 
visualizes the results. It has built-in support for more than hundred [report formats](SUPPORTED-FORMATS.md). 
Among the problems it can detect:
- errors from your compiler (C, C#, Java, etc.)
- warnings from a static analysis tool (CheckStyle, StyleCop, SpotBugs, etc.)
- duplications from a copy-and-paste detector (CPD, Simian, etc.)
- vulnerabilities
- open tasks in comments of your source files

The Jenkins **Next Generation** Warnings plug-in replaces the whole Jenkins Static Analysis Suite. 
I.e. it makes the following Jenkins plugins obsolete:
Android Lint, CheckStyle, Dry, FindBugs, PMD, Warnings, Static Analysis Utilities, Static Analysis Collector Plugins.

If your tool is not yet supported you can either define a new Groovy based parser in the user interface or provide 
a parser within a new small plug-in. If the parser is useful for other teams as well please share it and provide 
pull requests for the 
[Warnings Next Generation Plug-in](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/pulls) and 
the [Analysis Parsers Library](https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/pulls). 

The plugin publishes a report of the issues found in your build, so you can navigate to a summary report from the 
main build page. From there you can also dive into the details: 
- distribution of new, fixed and outstanding issues
- distribution of the issues by severity, category, type, module, or package
- list of all issues including helpful comments from the reporting tool
- annotated source code of the affected files
- trend charts of the issues

For more details please refer to the [documentation](doc/Documentation.md).
