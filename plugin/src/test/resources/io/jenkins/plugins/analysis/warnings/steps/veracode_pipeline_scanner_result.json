Writing untrusted data into a log file allows an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into log files.  Corrupted log files can be used to cover an attacker\u0027s tracks or as a delivery mechanism for an attack on a log viewing or processing utility.  For example, if a web administrator uses a browser-based utility to review logs, a cross-site scripting attack might be possible. The second argument to info() contains tainted data from the variables (new Object\\[...\\]). The tainted data originated from an earlier call to AnnotationVirtualController.vc_annotation_entry.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eAvoid directly embedding user input in log files when possible.  Sanitize untrusted data used to construct log entries by using a safe logging mechanism such as the OWASP ESAPI Logger, which will automatically remove unexpected carriage returns and line feeds and can be configured to use HTML entity encoding for non-alphanumeric data.  Alternatively, some of the XSS escaping functions from the OWASP Java Encoder project will also sanitize CRLF sequences.  Only create a custom blocklist when absolutely necessary.  Always validate untrusted input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eReferences: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html\"\u003eCWE\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Log_Injection\"\u003eOWASP\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_cleansers?tocId\u003dnYnZqAenFFZmB75MQrZwuA\"\u003eSupported Cleansers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e",
