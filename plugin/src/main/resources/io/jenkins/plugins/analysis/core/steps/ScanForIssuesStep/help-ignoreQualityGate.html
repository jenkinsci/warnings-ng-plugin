        If this option is set, only those issues are marked as new, that have been introduced in the current build.
        Previously new issues in older builds will be converted to outstanding issues. I.e. if someone starts a new
        build manually (without source code changes), then no new issues will be in the job anymore.

        By default, this option is disabled: then a build is selected as reference that passed all quality gates.
        As soon as a build fails a quality gate, the reference will be frozen until all new issues
        will be resolved again. That means, that new issues will be aggregated from build to build until the
        original reason for the failure and all those additional new issues have been resolved. This helps much more
        to keep your project clean: as soon as there are issues, Jenkins will mark all builds as unstable until
        the issues have been resolved.
