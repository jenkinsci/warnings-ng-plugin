<div>
    The results of the selected tool are published using a unique ID (i.e. URL) which must not be already used by
    another tool in this job. This ID is used as link to the results, so choose a short and meaningful name.
    Allowed elements are characters, digits, dashes and underscores (more precisely,
    the ID must match the regular expression `\p{Alnum}[\p{Alnum}-_]*`).
    If you leave the ID field empty, then the built-in default ID of the registered tool will be used.
