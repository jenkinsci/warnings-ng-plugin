    The healthy threshold defines the limit of warnings for a healthy result: A build is considered as 100% healthy
    when the number of issues is less than the specified threshold. Values less or equal zero are ignored.
    So if you want to have a healthy build (i.e. 100%) only for zero warnings, then set this field to 1.
