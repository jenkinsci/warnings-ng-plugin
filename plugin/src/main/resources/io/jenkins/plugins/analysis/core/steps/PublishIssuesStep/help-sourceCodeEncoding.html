<div>
    In order to correctly show all your affected source code files in the detail views,
    the plugin must open these files with the correct character encoding (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.).
    If you leave this field empty then the default encoding of the platform will be used. This might work but
    is not recommended.
