<div>
    The healthy threshold defines the limit of warnings for a healthy result: A build is considered as 100% healthy
    when the number of issues is less than the specified threshold.
    Set this field to 0 if you want boolean health reporting (100% for zero issues, 0% for any issues).
    Set this field to 1 if you want a healthy build (i.e., 100%) only for zero warnings with gradual degradation.
    Negative values are ignored.
