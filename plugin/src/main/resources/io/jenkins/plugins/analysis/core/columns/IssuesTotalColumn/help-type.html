<div>
    In order to simplify the user interface you can select the property that will be compared with the specified
    threshold. Basically, three different properties are available:
    <dl>
        <dt>Total</dt>
        <dd>Selects the total number of issues in the current build.</dd>
        <dt>New</dt>
        <dd>Selects the total number of new issues in the current build with respect to the reference build.
        </dd>
        <dt>Delta</dt>
        <dd>Selects the difference of the total number of issues of the current build subtracted by the total
            number of issues in the reference build.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    Additionally, you can select to choose all issues, or issues of a given severity only (error, high, normal or low).
