<div>
    If there are errors while scanning the console log or files for issues (e.g., file pattern matches no files, source files
    could not be copied, etc.) then the warning plugin will show these errors in a separate view but does not alter
    the build state. If you would rather like to fail the build on such errors, please tick this checkbox.
