<div>
    By default, each static analysis result will be recorded as a separate result
    that is presented as an individual Jenkins Action with separate UI and dashboard. If you rather prefer aggregation
    of the results into a single result (i.e., single Jenkins Action), then activate this check box. You still can
    see the distribution of issues grouped by static analysis tool in the UI.
