    If this option is unchecked, then the plugin automatically publishes the warnings to corresponding SCM platforms.
    For example, if you are using this feature for a GitHub organization project, the warnings will be published to
    GitHub through the Checks API. If this operation slows down your build or you don't want to publish the warnings to
    SCM platforms, you can use this option to deactivate this feature.
