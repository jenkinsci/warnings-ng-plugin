<div>
    The unhealthy threshold defines the limit of warnings for an unhealthy result: A build is considered as unhealthy
    (i.e. 0% health) when the number of issues is greater than the specified threshold. Values less or equal zero are ignored.
    So if you want to have a build health of 0% starting with 10 issues, then set this field to 9.
