    The unhealthy threshold defines the limit of warnings for an unhealthy result: A build is considered as unhealthy
    (i.e. 0% health) when the number of issues is greater than the specified threshold.
    If healthy is set to 0, this threshold is ignored and any issue count greater than 0 results in 0% health (boolean reporting).
    For gradual health degradation, set this to the threshold where health should reach 0% (e.g., 9 for 0% health at 10+ issues).
    Negative values are ignored.
