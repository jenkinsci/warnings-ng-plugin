<p>
    For each static analysis tool, a dedicated parser or scanner will be used to read report files or produce issues in
    any other way. If your tool is not yet supported, you can define a new Groovy based parser in Jenkins
    system configuration. You can reference this new parser afterward when you select the tool 'Groovy Parser'.
    Additionally, you provide a new parser within a new small plug-in. If the parser is useful for other teams
    as well, please share it and provide pull requests for the
    <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/pulls">Warnings Next Generation Plug-in</a> and
    the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/pulls">Analysis Parsers Library</a>.
