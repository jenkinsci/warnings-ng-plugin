  <p>
    If this option is enabled, the build will be stopped (marked as FAILURE)
    when a quality gate is missed with FAILED or ERROR status. This prevents the
    build from continuing when quality standards are not met.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a quality gate fails with WARNING status, the build will be marked as
    UNSTABLE but will continue to run (the build will not be stopped). This
    allows user to distinguish between critical failures that should stop the
    build and non-critical warnings that should only mark the build as unstable.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, this option is disabled: quality gates will only mark the build
    as UNSTABLE or FAILURE but will not stop the build execution. Enable this
    option when you want to enforce strict quality standards and prevent any
    subsequent build stages from running when quality gates are not met.
