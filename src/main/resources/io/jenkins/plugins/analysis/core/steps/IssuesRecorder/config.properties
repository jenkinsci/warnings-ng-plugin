title.tool=Static Analysis Tools
description.tool=Select one or more static analysis tool and pattern combinations. 

title.enabledForFailure=Run always
description.enabledForFailure=By default, static analysis results are only recorded for \
  stable or unstable builds, but not for failed builds: analysis results might be inaccurate if the build failed.\
  If recording should be enabled for failed builds as well then activate this check box.

title.aggregatingResults=Aggregate results
description.aggregatingResults=By default, each static analysis result will be recorded as a separate result \
  that is presented as an individual Jenkins Action with separate UI and dashboard. If you rather prefer aggregation \
  of the results into a single result (i.e., single Jenkins Action), then activate this check box. You still can \
  see the distribution of issues grouped by static analysis tool in the UI.
