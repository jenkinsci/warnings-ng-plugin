description.pattern=<a href="{0}">Fileset ''includes''</a> \
                 setting that specifies the files to scan for warnings. 
description.parser=If none of the parsers fits your project then you can create your own parser in the \
                 <a href="../../configure">system configuration</a> section. 
description.consoleLogParsers=The parsers to use when scanning the console log of the build. \
                 If no parser is selected then the console log will not be scanned for compiler warnings. 
description.logFilesParsers=Workspace files to scan for compiler warnings using a predefined parser. \
                 If none of the parsers fits your project then you can create your own parser in the \
                 <a href="../../configure">system configuration</a> section.
description.includePattern=Comma separated list of \
                 <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">regular expressions</a> \
                 that specifies the files to include in the report (based on their absolute filename). \
                 If this field is empty then all files are included.
description.excludePattern=Comma separated list of \
                 <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">regular expressions</a> \
                 that specifies the files to exclude from the report (based on their absolute filename).
description.detectModules=Determines if Ant or Maven modules should be detected for all files that contain \
        warnings. Activating this option may increase your build time since the detector scans the whole \
        workspace for ''build.xml'' or ''pom.xml'' files in order to assign the correct module names.
description.resolveRelativePaths=Determines if relative paths in warnings should be resolved using a time expensive operation \
        that scans the whole workspace for matching files. Deactivate this option if you encounter performance problems.
configure=You can define the default values for the trend graph in a separate view.
